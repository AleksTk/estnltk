## Command line scripts for processing corpora

This folder contains command line scripts that can be used for processing large corpora -- namely, Koondkorpus and etTenTen -- with EstNLTK 1.6.x

### Processing etTenTen

1. Download and unpack the corpus, e.g. from here: [https://metashare.ut.ee/repository/browse/ettenten-korpus-toortekst/b564ca760de111e6a6e4005056b4002419cacec839ad4b7a93c3f7c45a97c55f](https://metashare.ut.ee/repository/browse/ettenten-korpus-toortekst/b564ca760de111e6a6e4005056b4002419cacec839ad4b7a93c3f7c45a97c55f) 
2. Use the script `convert_ettenten_to_json.py` for splitting the large file into JSON format files, one file per each document of the corpus. You'll also need to create a new folder where the script can store the JSON format files.
3. (_Optional_) Use `split_large_corpus_files_into_subsets.py` for splitting the large set of files from the previous step into N smaller subsets. This will enable parallel processing of the subsets.
4.  Use the script `add_morph_and_save_results.py` to analyze the JSON format files with EstNLTK 1.6.x. You'll also need to create a new folder where the script can store the results of analysis. Optionally, you may want to evoke N instances of `add_morph_and_save_results.py` for faster processing. See `python add_morph_and_save_results.py -h` for details about processing options.

### Processing Koondkorpus

1.  First, you'll need to get [Koondkorpus](http://www.cl.ut.ee/korpused/segakorpus/) into JSON format. There are two options:

	a. You can download the Koondkorpus files that have already been converted into JSON format with EstNLTK 1.4. These files are available here: [http://ats.cs.ut.ee/keeletehnoloogia/estnltk/koond.zip](http://ats.cs.ut.ee/keeletehnoloogia/estnltk/koond.zip). _Note:_ this package _misses_ a subset of the corpus -- files from the newspaper SL Ã•htuleht. However, you can apply the step b. for acquiring the missing subset;

    b. Download Koondkorpus XML TEI files from [http://www.cl.ut.ee/korpused/segakorpus/index.php?lang=en](http://www.cl.ut.ee/korpused/segakorpus/index.php?lang=en). Then use EstNLTK 1.4.1, follow the instructions from the page [https://estnltk.github.io/estnltk/1.4.1/tutorials/tei.html](https://estnltk.github.io/estnltk/1.4.1/tutorials/tei.html), and convert the [corpus files](http://www.cl.ut.ee/korpused/segakorpus/) from XML TEI format to JSON format.

       * _Note_: Currently, conversion from XML TEI format to JSON format is not yet supported by EstNLTK 1.6.x. Our first priority was to develop the part of the pipeline that processes already existing JSON files and provides linguistic annotations. XML TEI to JSON conversion tools will be added in the future. Meanwhile, you can still use EstNLTK 1.4.1 to perform the conversion.

    Once you have acquired the corpus files in JSON format, you should copy all the files into a single folder.

2. (_Optional_) Use `split_large_corpus_files_into_subsets.py` for splitting the large set of files from the previous step into N smaller subsets. This will enable parallel processing of the subsets.
3.  Use the script `add_morph_and_save_results.py` to analyze the JSON format files with EstNLTK 1.6.x. You'll also need to create a new folder where the script can store the results of analysis. Optionally, you may want to evoke N instances of `add_morph_and_save_results.py` for faster processing. See `python add_morph_and_save_results.py -h` for details about processing options.
