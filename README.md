Estnltk -- Open source tools for Estonian natural language processing
=====================================================================

Estnltk provides common natural language processing functionality such as paragraph, sentence and word tokenization,
morphological analysis, named entity recognition, etc. for the Estonian language.

The project is funded by EKT (Eesti Keeletehnoloogia Riiklik Programm, https://www.keeletehnoloogia.ee/).


## Installation
The recommended way of installing estnltk is by using the [anaconda python distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and python 3.5+.

We have installable packages built for osx, windows-64, and linux-64.

The command for installing estnltk is:
```
conda install -c estnltk -c conda-forge estnltk
```

If you want to use EstNLTK in an interactive web application, type the command

```
jupyter notebook
```
To run our tutorials, [download them as a zip file](https://github.com/estnltk/tutorials/archive/master.zip), unpack them to a directory and run the command `jupyter notebook` in that directory.  

---------

The alternative way for installing if you are unable to use the anaconda distribution is:

`python -m pip install estnltk`

This is slower, more error-prone and requires you to have the appropriate compilers for building the scientific computation packages for your platform. 

Find more details in the [installation tutorial](http://estnltk.github.io/estnltk/1.4/tutorials/installation.html).
